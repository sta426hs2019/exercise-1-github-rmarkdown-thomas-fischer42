STA426 Week 1 Exercise (part b):
1. Acquaint yourself with knitR PDF/HTML Rmarkdown documents [1].
2. Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal
distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25); create a histogram of the 
distribution and the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and
variance of the sample in line in the text. (In general, do not just dump
the R code and plots in the HTML document; break your exercises into
sections with headings, add some text and make it readable.
